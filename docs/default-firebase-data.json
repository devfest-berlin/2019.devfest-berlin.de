Most applications are built with monolithic architectures - forcing the engineers to agree on a certain tech stack - due to the dependency chain. Designing features to be independent allows teams to work independently. This can of course be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage. On the one hand it doesn't force engineers to use the (maybe deprecated) tech stacks of their predecessors, on the other hand it can lead to very different engineering approaches being used.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we are going to take a look at the development cycle of modularized applications: Inception and the concept of modules, development and feature discoverability up until deployment and dynamic features. In addition to these it will give an overview of modularization approaches with common pitfalls and compare these approaches with a decoupled architecture.",

Therefore, the only way to get there was to reverse engineer it from scratch. I managed to get a working implementation for Linux and would like to share and discuss my approach to reverse engineering this protocol. I find reverse engineering these features very rewarding because as you go, you get the chance to really understand how things like h264, pcm audio, synchronization or USB data transfers work on a low level. \r\nIn my talk I will show you:\r\n- how to debug and analyze USB traffic on a Mac with Wireshark\r\n- easy ways of how to make sense of network/usb protocols just by looking at hex dump representations\r\n- how to implement a USB device codec with golang and libusb\r\n- and how to stream h264 video data over the network or save it to a file\r\n\r\nThe whole project is MIT licensed and well documented,\r\nso that anyone can go ahead and implement it in their favorite language.\r\n\r\n[github](https://github.com/danielpaulus/quicktime_video_hack)",

Companies will have a better set of criteria to sharpen their hiring process.\r\n\r\nEither way, this talk shows you what *really matters* — and how to steer clear of what doesn't.",

Originally focused for mobile app development, now you can also use it to build websites! \r\n\r\nEarlier this year, the Flutter team presented Flutter for web, a code-compatible implementation of Flutter that is rendered using standards-based web technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we are going to explore the capabilities of Flutter for web, the UI foundations of Flutter, and how all Flutter code is compiled to JavaScript that can run on any modern browser. You will learn how you can use Flutter to build mobile applications and websites with a single codebase. And if you never heard about Flutter before, do not worry, we will do an introduction for you.",
