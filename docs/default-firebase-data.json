Therefore, the only way to get there was to reverse engineer it from scratch. I managed to get a working implementation for Linux and would like to share and discuss my approach to reverse engineering this protocol.

Most applications are built with monolithic architectures - forcing the engineers to agree on a certain tech stack - due to the dependency chain. Designing features to be independent allows teams to work independently. This can of course be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage. On the one hand it doesn't force engineers to use the (maybe deprecated) tech stacks of their predecessors, on the other hand it can lead to very different engineering approaches being used.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we are going to take a look at the development cycle of modularized applications: Inception and the concept of modules, development and feature discoverability up until deployment and dynamic features. In addition to these it will give an overview of modularization approaches with common pitfalls and compare these approaches with a decoupled architecture.",
